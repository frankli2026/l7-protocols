*** WHAT'S GOING ON? ***

These are patterns (protocol definitions) for use with the Linux layer 7
packet classifier (l7-filter).  In order to use them, you will need the
Linux kernel and iptables patches available at http://sf.net/projects/l7-filter/

To install these patterns into their default location, say "make install".
 
The HOWTO at http://l7-filter.sf.net explains how to use l7-filter.

The HOWTO in this directory is a guide to writing patterns.

These patterns should be used only with version 0.4.0 or higher of the
l7-filter Netfilter kernel patch.


*** WHAT'S IN HERE? ***

The patterns in the "protocols" directory are the mainstream ones.  They 
match protocols like HTTP, FTP, eDonkey2000, Kazaa, and so on.

"extra" is for patterns of less general interest.

"malware" contains patterns for viruses and worms.  

"file_types" contains patterns for file types.

The "testing" directory contains a program for testing the speed and
accuracy of the patterns.


*** CAN I HELP? ***

Please report your experience with l7-filter and these patterns to
l7-filter-developers@lists.sf.net .  (Subscribe at

You can also e-mail Matthew Strait directly at quadong AT users.sf.net

Please note that many of these patterns were NOT written by experts.  So
if you think a pattern is broken and you know better, you may be right!
