Using these programs, you can:

- test the speed of patterns in user space.

- test whether your pattern matches random data (which is bad).

Start by saying "make".

************************************************************************

To test the speed of the pattern in the file "foo.pat":

./timeit.sh foo.pat

Or to test the pattern "foo|bar":

./timeit.sh 'foo|bar'

You'll find that our regexp library has some performance quirks.  For
instance, branches are very expensive.  Testing for "foo|bar" takes MUCH
longer than twice as long as testing for "foo".  Also, parentheses aren't 
optimized out.  That is, "(foo)" takes MUCH longer than "foo".

***********************************************************************

To test whether your pattern matches random data, run

./test_match.sh foo.pat
or
./test_match.sh 'foo|bar'
