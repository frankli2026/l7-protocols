Please read HOWTO for information on writing patterns.  Here are some
patterns we'd like to have:

Gadu-gadu - a popular Polish instant messenger protocol (so I'm told)
Zephyr - an instant messanger
Citrix - http://citrix.com

The below is taken from the list of protocols supported by the
Packeteer, a commercial packet shaper (see pg 197 of
www.packeteer.com/support/resources/41.refguide.pdf). Some of these are
important, but many are probably used so infrequently that they are not
really worth writing patterns for...
